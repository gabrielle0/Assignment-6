#Steps:
#Step 1: Create a program that automatically generate two random numbers to add (0 to 99).
#Step 2: Let the user answer and evaluate if the user has the correct answer.
#Step 3: The program will ask the user 10 addition operations.
#Step 4: Display the result summary of the 10 operations (ex 9/10).

def item1 ():
    given1 = random.randint (0, 99)
    given2 = random.randint (0, 99) 
    return answer1


answer1 = item1 ()
